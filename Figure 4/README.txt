***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to the data corresponding to Figure 4 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Hugo de Vries and Mirelle Geervliet (first authors of the manuscript). 
DOI: 10.4121/12999620
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of analysis***
To investigate how microbial composition of the gut microbiota develops over time

***Methodological information***
DNA was extracted from faecal and digesta samples, then PCR amplification was carried out with barcoded primers directed to the V4 region 
of the bacterial and archaeal 16 S rRNA gene. Samples were sent for Illumina HiSeq sequencing after which amplicon sequence data were processed and analysed using NG-Tax 2.0 and annotated using the SILVA 132 database.
Resulting data was imported into R-studio together with a metadata file to perform analyses and generate figures.

***Data specific information***
In the Figure 4 folder, two subfoldors can be found, namely:

1. Unprocessed_Figure:
This folder contains a PDF file with the figure as generated by R. 
This PDF file was used to create final Figure 4. 

2. Final_Figure:
This folder contains the final figure as presented in the manuscript. 
The final figure is prepared in Adoble Illustrator. 

Raw_data:
Raw Illumina sequencing data has been uploaded to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and can be found under the following accession number: PRJEB40329

R script: 
R script can be found under the following folder: Data_analyses_in_R_Studio
This folder also contains the data files used in the subfolder 'input_data'. This includes the metadata file, the .biom file and the .tre file.
