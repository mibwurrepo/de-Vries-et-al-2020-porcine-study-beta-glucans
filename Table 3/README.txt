***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to Table 3 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Hugo de Vries and Mirelle Geervliet (first authors of the manuscript). 
DOI: 10.4121/12999620
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of the experiment***
To investigate if B-glucans influences the local (MLN) cell response.

***Methodological information***
Isolated MLN cells were stained with a DC or T lymphocyte/NK cell antibody panel (see Table 1 manuscript). 
Flow cytometry data analysis was performed by using FlowJo software (Version 10).
Examples of the gating strategies can be found in the 'Supplementary Materials' of the manuscript; Figure S2 (DCs) and Figure S3 (T lymphocytes and NK cells).

***Data specific information***
All information (including raw data) related to this table is available in the folder 'Figure 8'.
