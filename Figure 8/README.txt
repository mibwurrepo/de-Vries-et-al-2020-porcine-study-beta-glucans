***General Introduction***
This README file corresponds to the data corresponding to Figure 7 of the manuscript.
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with pigs at the Wageningen University as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Hugo de Vries and Mirelle Geervliet (first authors of the manuscript). 
DOI: 10.4121/12999620
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

***Purpose of analysis***
To investigate if B-glucans influences the local (MLN) or systemic (PBMCs) cell response. 

***Methodological information***
Isolated PBMCs and MLN cells were stained with a DC or T lymphocyte/NK cell antibody panel (see Table 1 manuscript). 
Flow cytometry data analysis was performed by using FlowJo software (Version 10).
Examples of the gating strategies can be found in the 'Supplementary Materials' of the manuscript; Figure S2 (DCs) and Figure S3 (T lymphocytes and NK cells).

***Data specific information***

R script can be found under the following folder: Data_analyses_in_R_Studio.
This folder also contains the data files used in the subfolder 'input_data'. This includes the metadata file.

In folder 'Figure 8', four subfolders can be found namely:

1. Raw_data:
You can find here two folders (MLN and PBMCs) each containing 6 excel files which includes the raw data results from MLN and PBMCs at different time points. 
Values generated are percentages (frequency of the parent population) or 'mean fluorescent intensity' values (also referred to in the headings as 'Median'). 
The Excel files are generated and exported by using Flowjo.

2. Unprocessed_Figure:
This folder contains six PDF files with the figures as generated by R. 
These six PDF files are combined as Figure 8. 

3. Final_Figure:
This folder contains the final figure as presented in the manuscript. 
The final figure is prepared in Adoble Illustrator. 

4. Excel_File_R
Contains all Excel (csv) files used for the R code to generate graphs and for statistical analysis. 
This folder contains two subfolders named 'Flowcytometry_MLN' and 'Flowcytometry_PBMC' containing both 28 Excel files (csv). 
When data was not normally distrubuted, log-transformed data was used to perform statistical analysis and is indicated in the Excel file names (includes 'LOG').
