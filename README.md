***General Introduction***
This dataset contains data collected during an in vivo experiment with piglets as part of the PhD Thesis Projects of Hugo de Vries and Mirelle Geervliet (first authors of the manuscript). 
DOI: 10.4121/12999620
This research project was made possible by The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and Vereniging Diervoeders Nederland (VDN).

Date of study: September until November 2018
Location of study: Swine Research Centre, St. Antonis, The Netherlands

***Purpose of the study***
In this study, we investigated whether early life supplementation of yeast-derived β-glucans affects the gut microbiota as well as the immune system. 
In addition, we examined the temporal dynamics of these complex systems. 
We hypothesized that early life consumption of yeast-derived β-glucans alters gut microbiota development (composition) and the immune system. 
A more developed and mature gut microbiota and immune system in early life could make the animals more resilient against invasive pathogens during the weaning phase and later in life.

***Description of the data in this dataset***
The data included in this dataset has been organized by folders which includes raw data of one or multiple figures. Every folder contains a seperate README.txt file with a description of the file structure.
Please note that there is not a folder named 'Figure 1' and a folder named 'Table 1' as this figure and table do not present results. 
Please note that there is not a folder named 'S1 Table', S2 Figure' and 'S3 Figure' as the table gives information about the diet and the figures present examples of the gating strategies.

Every Figure has its own folder, each containing subfolders with seperate readme files. 

In addition to data belonging to the figures, the folder named 'Data_analysis_in_R_Studio' contains all files related to the analyses performed in R.

Alternatively, all files can be found under the following Github page: https://github.com/mibwurrepo/de-Vries-et-al-2020-porcine-study-betaglucans

***Instructions***
1. Download the repository and unzip.
2. Inspect the figure folders individually to assess the raw figures, the final figures and data files corresponding to each figure.
3. Open the HTML file named 'Porcine_study_Y_glucan_R_analyses_july2020_markdown_file' for a complete overview of the analyses in R or alternatively open the 'Data_analyses_in_R_Studio' folder and run the analyses yourself in R-Studio.
